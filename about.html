            The Broadway Journal (1845-46), one of the four principal magazines that Edgar Allan Poe helped to edit, is here offered in a digital edition.  This edition uses Poe's career as a magazinist as an entry point into antebellum print culture.  In the articles, essays, tales, poetry, reviews, and illustrations published in this magazine, readers can get a sense of the issues, interests, and controversies that engaged the denizens of Jacksonian America.  So too will readers learn about the literary and aesthetic modes popular at the time, tastes that Poe helped shape in his role as an editor.<br><br>

            The Broadway Journal manifests the new nation's rapidly expanding print culture.  In 1800, there were 300 periodicals in the United States; by 1850, that number had risen to 1500.  This expansion shaped American literary culture of the era, including the profession of authorship.  While part of a transatlantic network - especially since a lack of international copyright meant a firm embrace of what Meredith McGill has called the "culture of reprinting" - American authors found new venues in the pages of the proliferating magazines and newspapers.<br><br>

            The rise of the periodical press shaped the role of the author in many ways: not only where authors could publish, but also regarding issues of pay, cultural capital, intellectual property, and more. Moreover, it is is in the pages that the literary network of the era is visible, in the names of the authors who were published and reviewed.   Yet 19th-century practices of attribution make it difficult to know who was published and where, since many pieces were published anonymously or with no attribution whatsoever.  When an author was identified, often it would be done by full name, but sometime only by initials (at times only a last initial).  Identifying authors within periodical is thus a rich field for study.  This digital edition of The Broadway Journal focuses on issues of authorship.   In addition to the corrected pages of the journal available for viewing, this project uses the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to identify the author of each piece in the 48 issues, including anonymous, pseudonymous, and unidentified works.  As a result, readers can see which authors were published and how frequently, and how they were identified - or not.<br><br>

            This project focus was identified by the graduate students who summarized, corrected, and encoded the issues (Doan, Gilliland, Johnson, and Powell) in consultation with the project lead (Coats).  We plan to build on this project by identifying authors in other journals of the time period, in addition to identifying authors as they are referenced in The Broadway Journal (e.g., an author whose work in the subject of a review, or mention in one of Poe's critiques of American literary culture).  While digital versions of many of the era's periodicals are available through open-source and subscription databses (e.g., American Periodical Seires, The Making of America), authorship of individuals pieces is rarely addressed or addressed consistently (especially for works that are published without author attribution, under a pen name, or with author's initials only).   Making nineteenth-century authorship --- in its many, often messy forms - and author networks visible is the project's goal.

            The journal was scanned from facsimile.  OCR was completed with ABBYY FineReader 12.0, and then hand corrected.  Markup was completed following TEI: P5 Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange. The project team encodes basic structural markup to TEI Level 3, and level 4 elements to mark the titles and authors of the journal's content.  (For a description of TEI levels, see Best Practices for TEI in Libraries, version 3.0.) The TEI-encoded issues are used to derive the tables of content and the author index.
